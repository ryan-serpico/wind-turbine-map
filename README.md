Hey there!

This repository contains all the data and code I used to create my short story for the San Antonio Express-News that searched for wind turbine concentrations in Texas.

**Questions we answered using the data**:

- How many turbines currently operate across the country?
- How many currently operate in Texas?
- Which Texas counties have the most turbines?
- Which wind farms are the largest in Texas?

The analysis and results can be found in my `wind-turbine-analysis.ipynb` notebook.

If you're a reporter from another news organization and want to use this data and analysis to create a quick story for your own local market, please do! I'd love to see what you come up with, especially if you add a little twist to it! Reach out to me on social media.

Not the most exciting analysis here, but I wanted to get my feet wet with sharing my work on GitHub. I'm hoping to do more of this in the future.

## Reproducibility

All the python libraries used in this project are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

I encourage you to reproduce this project. You can run back my notebook by running `nbexec wind-turbine-analysis.ipynb` in your terminal (shoutout to [The Markup](https://github.com/the-markup) for putting [nbless](https://github.com/py4ds/nbless) on my rader!)

## Data dictionary

You can find the data dictionary for the data used in this project on the USGS' website [here](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/api-doc/#keyValue).

But for quick reference, I'm including the data dictionary below:

## What is extract-texas.py?

I used this script to extract the Texas state border outline from the U.S. Census Bureau's [TIGER/Line® shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php) for the [animated Flourish map](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/13017470/).

You can find the Texas state border shapefile in `output/texas.geojson`.
